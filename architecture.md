# CircularIQ Platform Architecture and Product Plan

## üìì Executive Summary

CircularIQ is a modular, AI-augmented sustainability intelligence platform designed to help African businesses ‚Äî particularly SMEs ‚Äî measure their plastic usage, comply with environmental regulations (such as Kenya‚Äôs EMCA and EPR laws), and adopt circular economy strategies. This document is the source-of-truth for agents and developers to autonomously scaffold, build, and iterate on the CircularIQ platform using Nuxt 4, Node.js, Supabase, and TailwindCSS v4.

Refer to [TailwindCSS v4 release notes](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4) for up-to-date utility usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI Agent Development Mode (Overview)

To enable seamless integration and productivity with AI-based development agents:

* The platform uses **file-based routing** for all pages listed in the sitemap.
* Typed API services and Supabase-native schemas are required for backend and data layers.
* UI is componentized with TailwindCSS v4 utility classes and custom tokens via `@theme`.
* Architecture favors modularization and predictable project structure.
* Page layout images and design references are stored in `app/docs/ui/` (PNG for quick reference, PDF for detailed layout).
* UI prompt files for AI agents are stored in `/docs/ui-prompts/`.

> üß† Agents must prioritize maintainability, reusability, and step-by-step scaffolding, starting with onboarding, CSV upload parsing, and dashboards.

## üìä Vision & Strategic Pillars

* **Empower African enterprises** to achieve environmental transparency and compliance.
* **Automate** the collection, tracking, and reporting of packaging and waste data.
* **Embed circular principles** into business processes for long-term resilience.
* **Bridge policy and technology** through localized, regulation-aware tooling.

## üåà Tailwind v4 Color Theme

Define the CircularIQ brand theme in `assets/css/main.css`:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@theme {
  colors: {
    primary: #28A745;
    accent: #98FF98;
    forest: #14532D;
    background: #EFFBF0;
    surface: #F4F4F4;
    muted: #6B7280;
    success: #34D399;
    warning: #FBBF24;
    danger: #EF4444;
    info: #3B82F6;
  }
}
```

Use `bg-primary`, `text-accent`, etc. via native utility classes.

## üóÑÔ∏è Supabase Data Model Integration

The following tables are set up in Supabase and should be mapped directly to frontend modules, API endpoints, and business logic. Use Supabase's `supabase-js` client for all data operations.

| Table                | Usage/Module Mapping                                      |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| users                | Auth, profile, role assignment                           |
| companies            | Company onboarding, sector, region, compliance status    |
| user_companies       | Multi-tenant role support, company-user mapping          |
| products             | SKU management, material, recyclability, reuse           |
| uploads              | CSV/manual uploads, parse status, error summary          |
| footprint_reports    | Plastic mass, CO‚ÇÇ, monthly aggregation                   |
| compliance_scores    | Regulation matching, scoring, flagged issues             |
| recommendations      | AI-generated actions, cost, difficulty, confidence       |
| activity_logs        | Audit trail, user actions, meta                          |
| billing_plans        | Plan selection, limits, pricing                          |
| partners             | Directory, region/type, contact info                     |
| notifications        | Alerts, deadlines, compliance, read status               |

## üìë Modular Architecture & Scaffolding Instructions

Each module should be scaffolded as a folder with:

* A page (`.vue`) for the route, matching the sitemap.
* Reusable UI components (cards, tables, forms) in `/components/ui/`.
* Composables for logic in `/composables/` (e.g., `useCompanies`, `useProducts`, `useUploads`) to encapsulate Supabase queries and mutations.
* Supabase calls via `supabase-js` in composables only.
* Reference corresponding layout images in `app/docs/ui/` for visual fidelity.
* Use `/docs/ui-prompts/` for AI prompt engineering and UI copy.

## üíª AI Development Guidelines

1. Use file-based routing for all pages in the sitemap.
2. Generate `.vue` files in `/pages/` for each route.
3. Create composables (e.g., `useCompanies`, `useProducts`, `useUploads`) in `/composables/` for each table.
4. Build UI components in `/components/ui/` (Card, Button, Badge, Table, Form).
5. Use Tailwind classes with `@theme` tokens (`bg-primary`, etc.).
6. Call Supabase client from composables only (for separation of concerns).
7. Render data in tables using reactive state (`ref([])` + `watchEffect`).
8. For OpenAI, define API route `/api/recommendations` and feed JSON payload.
9. Use `/docs/ui-prompts/*.txt` for Stitch prompts and UI copy, and `app/docs/ui/*.png`/`*.pdf` for design references.
10. Scaffold modules to match table structure and relationships.
11. Enforce access control via Supabase Auth and RLS.
12. Keep UI in sync with schema: update forms/tables as schema evolves.
13. Document composables and API endpoints for each table.
14. Use incremental commits: `feat: add products composable`, `feat: dashboard charts`.
15. Always cross-reference UI assets for layout and visual consistency.
